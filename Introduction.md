Great! I'm excited to be your personal tutor and coding assistant for **Low-Level System Design + Design Patterns + SOLID Principles** by Prateek Narang (Coding Minutes). This is one of the best courses available in India for mastering LLD and OOP concepts properly.

### Recommended Tools & Setup (Before You Start)

| Tool | Why you need it | Recommendation |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| **IDE** | Fast coding, refactoring, debugging | IntelliJ IDEA Community (best for Java) or Visual Studio Code + Java extensions |
| **Language** | The course primarily uses **Java** (sometimes C++) | Java 17 or Java 21 LTS (latest LTS as of 2025) |
| **Build tool** | Proper project structure, dependency management | Maven or Gradle (course uses Maven in most projects) |
| **Version Control** | You will build many projects | Git + GitHub (create a private repo for all course projects) |
| **Diagramming tool** | For drawing class/UML diagrams | draw.io (free), Excalidraw, or Lucidchart |
| **Note-taking** | To summarize every pattern & principle | Notion / Obsidian / Typora (I recommend Notion with a database for patterns) |
| **Testing framework** | To practice writing clean, testable code | JUnit 5 (you’ll use it a lot later) |
| **Linter/Formatter** | Code style consistency | Google Java Format or Spotless (Maven/Gradle plugin) |

Quick setup script (if using IntelliJ + Maven):

1. Install JDK 21: https:// adoptium.net
2. Install IntelliJ IDEA Community
3. Install Maven (comes with IntelliJ usually)
4. Create a GitHub repo: `lld-design-patterns-2025`
5. Create a Notion page with this template (I can give you one later)

### Suggested Study Plan (12–16 weeks, ~10–12 hrs/week)

| Week | Topics (approx. from course) | Goals | Mini-Project / Practice |
|------|------------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
| 1     | OOP Revision + SOLID Principles (all 5 in depth) | Deeply internalize SOLID | Refactor a badly written “Banking System” (I’ll give you bad code) |
| 2     | Creational Patterns – Part 1<br>(Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory) | Master object creation | Build Thread-safe Singleton variants + Config Loader using Abstract Factory |
| 3     | Creational Patterns – Part 2<br>(Builder, Prototype) | Handle complex object construction | Design a “Pizza Builder” + “Document Clone” system |
| 4     | Structural Patterns – Part 1<br>(Adapter, Bridge, Composite) | Connect incompatible interfaces | File system explorer (Composite) + Payment gateway adapter |
| 5     | Structural Patterns – Part 2<br>(Decorator, Facade, Proxy) | Add behavior dynamically | Coffee shop billing (Decorator) + Cache proxy |
| 6     | Behavioral Patterns – Part 1<br>(Strategy, Observer, Template Method) | Change algorithms at runtime | Discount engine (Strategy) + Stock ticker (Observer) |
| 7     | Behavioral Patterns – Part 2<br>(Command, State, Chain of Responsibility) | Encapsulate requests & state changes | Undo-redo text editor (Command) + Order processing pipeline |
| 8     | Behavioral Patterns – Part 3<br>(Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Visitor) | Complete behavioral mastery | Custom List with Iterator + Chat room (Mediator) |
| 9–10  | Low-Level Design Problems – Beginner to Medium<br>(Parking Lot, Tic-Tac-Toe, Snake & Ladder) | Apply everything together | Code all three from scratch (we’ll do full design + code review) |
| 11–12 | Low-Level Design Problems – Advanced<br>(BookMyShow / Movie Ticket Booking, Splitwise, Cab Booking (simplified)) | Real-world complexity | We’ll build one full system together step-by-step |
| 13–14 | Design Twitter / TinyURL / Rate Limiter / Cricinfo | High-scale thinking | Focus on trade-offs, extensibility |
| 15–16 | Revision + Mock Interviews + Refactoring old code | Polish everything | I’ll give you 8–10 LLD interview questions daily + full code review |

### How We Will Work Together (Rules of Engagement)

1. You watch the lecture → try the exercise yourself first (very important!)
2. Paste your code / doubts here. I will:
   - Explain any concept you didn’t understand deeply
   - Break down the instructor’s code in plain English
   - Point out improvements (better naming, SOLID violations, modern Java, etc.)
   - Never give you the full solution until you’ve tried
3. After each major section, I’ll give you a custom mini-challenge (slightly different from course)
4. I’ll maintain a running “Knowledge Tracker” so we know exactly what you’ve mastered and what needs revision.

### Let’s Start!

Step 1: Set up your environment (JDK 21 + IntelliJ + Maven + GitHub repo)

Step 2: Tell me when you’re ready and which section you’re starting with (most people start with SOLID Principles).

Just say:  
“Setup done ✅ Starting with SOLID Principles”

…and we’ll dive deep into Single Responsibility Principle with real code examples and a small refactoring exercise.

Ready when you are! 🚀
